## Project Overview

I worked on extending Demucs, an open-source tool that uses AI to split songs into their individual parts‚Äîlike separating the vocals from the drums, bass, and other instruments. It's pretty cool tech that musicians and producers use all the time for remixes, karaoke tracks, or just messing around with their favorite songs. I added batch processing so you can throw a whole folder of tracks at it and let it do its thing, which saves a ton of time if you're working with lots of files.
