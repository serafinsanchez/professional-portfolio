This project was a fun challenge that really pushed the boundaries of what form widgets can do. Instead of boring old forms, we created something that feels modern and engaging‚Äîlike Typeform but embeddable anywhere. The coolest part was figuring out how to make it work perfectly on any website without breaking their styles or functionality.

The technical side was pretty interesting too. We had to solve some tricky problems around cross-platform compatibility and real-time data sync, but the end result is something that just works. The client can drop this widget into their BigCommercesite with a simple code snippet, and their customers get a smooth experience that actually encourages them to complete the form.

What I'm most proud of is how we managed to keep that premium feel while making it super accessible and performant. It loads fast, works great on mobile, and doesn't feel like another boring contact form. Plus, the real-time data updates mean businesses can see feedback rolling in live, which is pretty satisfying to watch.
