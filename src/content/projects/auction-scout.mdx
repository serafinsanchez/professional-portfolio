# Auction Scout

A modern web application designed for auction enthusiasts, bidders, and administrators who want a unified, real-time view of live auctions and items from multiple sources. The platform aggregates, normalizes, and presents auction data through a robust backend API, offers a responsive React frontend, and features AI-powered price estimation for any auction item, making it easy to browse, analyze, and value lots with confidence.

## Project Overview

Auction Scout empowers users to discover, analyze, and value auction items in real time by aggregating data from multiple sources and providing instant, AI-powered price estimates. It streamlines the auction browsing experience, supports informed bidding, and gives auction managers operational visibility and data export tools.
