## Project Overview

I built this transcription tool because I was tired of paying monthly subscriptions for basic audio transcription services. It's a simple tool that I used to transcribe autio from NotebookLM audio overviews but also works with other interview recordings.

This tool provides straightforward audio-to-text conversion with speaker identification and custom labeling. It supports multiple audio formats and languages, includes translation capabilities, and can export results in various formats including subtitle files for video projects.
