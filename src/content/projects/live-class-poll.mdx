# Next.js 15 Real-Time Classroom Polling with Firebase and QR Access

## Project Overview

Live Class Poll revolutionizes classroom engagement by providing educators with a lightning-fast, zero-friction polling platform that works seamlessly across all devices. Designed specifically for educational environments, particularly music production courses, the application eliminates traditional barriers to student participation through instant poll creation, QR code sharing, and real-time results visualization.

The platform addresses the critical challenge of passive learning by empowering instructors to create interactive moments that gauge student understanding, collect feedback, and adapt teaching strategies in real-time. With no account registration required for students and 30-second setup time for educators, it transforms any classroom into an dynamic, data-driven learning environment.

Built with modern web technologies and real-time architecture, Live Class Poll scales from intimate classroom settings to large lecture halls while maintaining the simplicity that makes it accessible to educators of all technical backgrounds.
