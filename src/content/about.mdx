  excerpt: 'AI native developer from Colorado with a background in music technology and community building'
}




I'm an AI native developer based in Colorado who turns ideas into working solutions through AI assisted coding workflows. 

## My Background

My path here isn't typical. I spent over a decade in music technology, leading community teams at Ableton, teaching audio production in HigherEd, and managing music programs for nonprofits. I have degrees in jazz performance and pedagogy from CU Boulder, and a deep career as a professional muscian which taught me how to improvise, collaborate, and think creatively under pressure.

These days I'm focused on using AI to rapidly prototype, solve business problems, and explore new ideas. Recently I've been building everything from audio stem separation apps, ecommerce platforms, interactive event tools and small business tools and automations to make everyday life easier. I work with a wide variety of front and backend technologies, including React, Next.js, Python, and whatever else gets the job done.

## What I Actually Do

I thrive at the intersection of technology, creativity, and user experience. My background in product and community work means I think about the whole experience not just the code. I've led teams, conducted user research, and built educational programs, so I understand how people actually use things and enjoy learn from and listeing to users and engineers.

I'm always learning something new. Recently that's been diving deeper into AI/ML through Harvard's AI for Business Leaders program and DeepLearning.ai courses. I love figuring out how to make complex tech accessible and useful for real people.

## When I'm Not Coding

You'll find me exploring Colorado, playing saxophone, or tinkering with audio gear and making beats. I still keep one foot in the music world it keeps me grounded and reminds me that the best technology serves human creativity.
