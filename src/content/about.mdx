  excerpt: 'AI native developer from Colorado with a background in music technology and community building'
}




I'm a full stack, AI native developer based in Colorado. I'm focused on helping businesses solve problems and exploring creative ways of using technology. 

## My Background

I spent over a decade in music technology, leading community and marketing teams at Ableton, teaching in HigherEd and K12, and building music programs for nonprofits. I have degrees in jazz performance and pedagogy from CU Boulder, and a deep career as a professional muscian which taught me how to improvise, collaborate, and think creatively under pressure. My roots as a musician also instilled discipline and an appreciation for how communities connect, communicate and create.

These days I'm focused on using AI to rapidly prototype, solve problems, and explore new ways to express myself creatively through technology. Recently I've been building everything from audio stem separation apps, ecommerce platforms, interactive event tools and small business tools that automate daily tasks to make everyday life easier. I work with a wide range of front and backend technologies.

I thrive at the intersection of technology, creativity, and user experience. My background in product and community work helps me think about the entire experience not just the code. I've led remote teams, conducted user research, and enjoy learning from and listeing to users and engineers.

I'm always learning something new and I love figuring out how to make complex tech accessible and useful for all audiences.

## When I'm Not Coding

You'll find me exploring Colorado, playing saxophone or piano and making beats in my home studio. I still keep one foot in the music world and regulalry perform at local venues here in the Denver Metro area.
