# Building MagicMiro: Adding a Missing Feature to Miro

## The Problem: Death by a Thousand Copy-Pastes

I live in Miro boards daily for both work and personal projects. Whether organizing user stories, feedback items, or brainstorming points, I found myself repeating the same tedious workflow: Copy text. Create new sticky note. Paste. Repeat. Miro offered a paste-as-separate-stickies feature for spreadsheets, but it failed with plain multi-line text.

## Validating the Problem

I wasn't alone. A quick search through Miro community forums and Reddit revealed dozens of frustrated users describing the same workflow bottleneck.

To validate demand, I built a simple web app that converted clipboard text into Miro's expected format. The proof of concept worked, but the feedback was unanimous: **switching between browser tabs broke the flow almost as much as the original problem.** 

People needed something that lived *in* their workflow, not beside it. A native menu bar app was the answer.

## What MagicMiro Does

MagicMiro is a lightweight macOS menu bar app that converts clipboard text into a format Miro recognizes as multiple sticky notes. Simple by design.

Here's the workflow:

1. **Copy any multi-line text** (user stories, feedback, task lists)
2. **Press CMD+G** (customizable) to convert your clipboard
3. **Paste in Miro** (CMD+V) and select "Paste data as separate sticky notes"
4. **Watch dozens of sticky notes appear instantly** ðŸŽ‰

## How It Works 

Say you have a list like this:

```
Apple
Apricot
Avocado
Artichoke
Asparagus
Almond
```

**Without MagicMiro:** Pasting this into Miro creates one big text block.

**With MagicMiro:** After copying and pressing CMD+G, paste into Miro and select "Paste data as separate sticky notes." Each line becomes its own sticky note:

No more manual line-by-line creation.

## Who Benefits Most

- **Product managers** organizing user stories and requirements
- **UX researchers** categorizing user feedback and insights
- **Scrum masters** preparing sprint planning sessions
- **Designers** organizing design system components
- **Workshop facilitators** running remote brainstorming sessions
