- Instead of "seamless integration," say "easy to connect with existing systems"

### Use Active Voice
- "We will optimize the process" → "We will improve the process"
- "This solution empowers users" → "This solution helps users"

### Add Real Details
- Include specific examples, numbers, or concrete descriptions
- Mention actual problems and how you solve them
- Use real user stories or case studies

### Keep It Human
- Write like you're talking to a friend
- Avoid formal business language unless necessary
- Use contractions (don't, can't, won't)
- Ask questions to engage readers

## Quick Checklist
Before publishing, ask yourself:
- Does this sound like something a real person would say?
- Could I explain this to a friend over coffee?
- Am I using specific examples instead of vague promises?
- Does this avoid marketing buzzwords?
