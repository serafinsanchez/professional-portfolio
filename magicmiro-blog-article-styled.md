## The problem every Miro user knows too well

I live in Miro boards daily for both work and personal projects. If found myself often needing to manually create dozens of sticky notes in Miro from a list of user stories, feedback items, and brainstorming points. Copy. Create new sticky note. Paste. Repeat. When pasting from a spreadsheet, Miro did have a feature that would paste as separate sticky notes, but it didn't work well with multiple lines of text.

## Validating the problem

I wasn't alone in this frustration. Searching through Miro community forums and Reddit, I found dozens of posts from other users describing the same tedious workflow and looking for a solution.

To test if a solution would actually be useful to others, I built a simple web app that could convert clipboard text into the right format for that allowed pasting as separate sticky notes. Users could copy their text, paste it into the web tool, convert it, then copy the result back to paste into Miro.

The feedback was clear: **having to switch between browser tabs broke the flow almost as much as the original problem.** What people really wanted was something that lived right in their workflow. That's when I decided a native menu bar app was the right solution.

## What MagicMiro does

MagicMiro is a lightweight macOS application that runs in your menu bar and converts clipboard text into a format that Miro recognizes as multiple sticky notes. It feels simple on purpose.

Here's what happens

1. **Copy any multi line text** (user stories, feedback, task lists)
2. **Press CMD+G** (customizable) to convert your clipboard
3. **Paste in Miro** (CMD+V) and select "Paste data as separate sticky notes"
4. **Watch as dozens of sticky notes appear instantly** ðŸŽ‰

## Could be most useful for:

- **Product manager** organizing user stories and requirements
- **UX researcher** categorizing user feedback and insights
- **Scrum master** preparing sprint planning sessions
- **Designer** organizing design system components
